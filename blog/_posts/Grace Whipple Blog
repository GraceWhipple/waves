In the WAVES Summer Workshop, I have worked with Dr. Mead to learn R code and incorporate this code into Avida-ED activities for students. I have worked with Dr. Mead previously as I took her IBIO 150 course at Michigan State University. âœ¨ Go Green! âœ¨
Some things I will discuss in my post include:

-Life before WAVES

-Learning.to.Code.R -> c(The, Ups, and, Downs)

-What I Have Learned

-Going Forward

[Section 'Life Before WAVES']

Before the WAVES summer workshop, I had: zero, none, not a bit, zilch coding experience. I was definitely very intimidated by the thought of doing a computer science internship for two months. I was barely proficient in excel, yet alone in c++ or java scriptðŸ˜°. I was first introduced to the WAVES summer workshop by Dr. Mead. I had worked with Avida-ED extensively in her class. Although I lack strong computer skills, my positive experience with Avida-ED motivated me to apply for the summer workshop. Before moving to Michigan for college, I lived in Boise Idaho. There is little opportunity within the STEM field here. The vast opportunity that I have as a student at Michigan State University in comparison to life in Boise pushes me to leave my comfort zone and is another reason why I decided to apply for the WAVES summer workshop.

[Section 'Learning.to.Code.R-> c(The,Ups,and,Downs)]

I wasn't sure what to expect when I began my R coding journey. I can gladly say that it has been a very experience.
As I previously stated, I have never been particularly techy. It was a slow start, but I soon realized that coding R was something I enjoyed. The efficiency of being able to code the program to both create graphs and complete equations for me was so fulfilling- not to mention I didn't have to do the math myself ðŸ¤£. This was something entirely outside of my comfort zone that I feel I can use in my career in science going forward.
Here is an example of a basic graph I created using R.

*A histogram was the first graph I learned how to create on R*


[Section 'What I Have Learned']

I would say one of the biggest things I have gained throughout this experience is a new perspective by pushing my boundaries in ways that I didn't realize I could accomplish. I have had such a fulfilling experience with the WAVES workshop. I also found the enrichment sessions incredibly informative. All of the mentors have been so kind and helpful, and my new found skills in R are something that I will surely use again. Writing an activity for students that incorporate both R and Avida-ED was a very rewarding way to put my practice to use. I hope to continue my work with Dr. Mead, and to reach out to some of the mentors from MSU that I will be on campus with in the Fall.

[Section 'Going Forward']

Going forward, I plan to continue to expand my knowledge and skills in R Studio. There are so many resources online that I have found beneficial in overcoming obstacles in R. I will continue to use these resources in order to further my skills. I will also be more confident going forward when participating in something outside using new perspectives that I have gained through this internship to my advantage throughout my future career. Having such a positive experience has encouraged me to be even more professionally outgoing.
